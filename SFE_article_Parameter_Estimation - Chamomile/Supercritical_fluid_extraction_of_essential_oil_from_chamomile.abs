This study investigated the supercritical extraction process of chamomile extract from chamomile flowers. A distributed-parameter model describes the fluid-solid extraction process. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. Model parameters, including the partition factor, internal diffusion coefficient, axial diffusion coefficient, and decaying factor, were determined through maximum likelihood estimation based on experimental data, with the assumption of normally distributed errors. A set of laboratory experiments was performed under multiple constant operating conditions: $30 - 40^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \times 10^{-5}$ kg/s.
