This study investigated the supercritical extraction process of chamomile oil from chamomile seeds. A distributed-parameter model describes the fluid-solid extraction process. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. Key model parameters included partition factor internal and axial diffusion coefficients were determined using maximum likelihood estimation from experimental data, assuming normal error. A set of laboratory experiments was performed in under multiple constant operating conditions: $30 - 40^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \times 10^{-5}$ kg/s.
