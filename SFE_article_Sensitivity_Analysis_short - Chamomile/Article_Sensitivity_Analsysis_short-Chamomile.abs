This study aimed to investigate the supercritical extraction process of caraway oil from chamomile flowers. The distributed-parameter model describes the fluid-solid extraction process. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. A set of laboratory experiments was performed under multiple constant operating conditions: $30 - 40^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s. Sensitivity analyses play a crucial role in assessing the robustness of the findings or conclusions based on mathematical model. The local sensitivity analysis investigates the influence of infinitely small changes in the inlet temperature, pressure, and flow rate on the extraction yield.
