	This work investigates the influence of inlet temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate on the state space and the extraction yield. The process model and parameters have been discussed in {\color{red}article 1}. The process model was calibrated on the set of experiments obtained at different operating conditions, $30 - 40^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \times 10^{-5}$ kg/s. The sensitivity analysis has been performed assuming that the system operates at $35^\circ C$, 150 bar and 5 $\times 10^{-5}$ kg/s.
