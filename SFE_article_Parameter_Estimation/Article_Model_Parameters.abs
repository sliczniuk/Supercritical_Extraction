This study aimed to investigate the supercritical extraction process of the caraway oil from caraway seeds. The extraction was performed in a partially filled extractor with a fixed bed operated under multiple constant operating conditions. The dataset collected from four experiments consists of four experiments conducted at different operating conditions: $40^\circ C$/$200$ bar, $50^\circ C$/$200$ bar, $40^\circ C$/$300$ bar, and $50^\circ C$/$300$ bar. A distributed-parameter model is used to describe the fluid-solid extraction process with $CO_2$ as a solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. This model requires parameters such as partition factor, internal diffusion coefficient, axial diffusion coefficient, saturation concentration, and an initial state estimate. These parameters are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state and by applying the maximum likelihood estimation method on yield data under the normal error assumption.
