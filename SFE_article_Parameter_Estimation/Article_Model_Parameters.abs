This study aimed to investigate the supercritical extraction process of the caraway oil from caraway seeds. A distributed-parameter model is used to describe the fluid-solid extraction process with carbon dioxide as a solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. This model requires parameters such as partition factor, internal diffusion coefficient, axial diffusion coefficient. The missing model parameters and the initial state are obtained by solving the maximum likelihood estimation based on experimental yield data under the normal error assumption. A set of laboratory experiments was performed in a partially filled extractor with a fixed bed operated under multiple constant operating conditions: $40~^\circ C$ / $200$ bar, $50~^\circ C$ / $200$ bar, $40~^\circ C$ / $300$ bar, and $50~^\circ C$ / $300$ bar.
