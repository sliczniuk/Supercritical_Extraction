	An equation of state (EoS) is an algebraic relation between P, $v_m$, and T. Cubic equations of state are a specific class of thermodynamic models for modeling the pressure of a gas as a function of temperature and density and which can be rewritten as a cubic function of the molar volume. In general, the general cubic equation of state has a number of degrees of freedom equal to 2 + the number of components in the system (total flow rate, temperature, pressure and N-1 mole fractions). In some cases (primarily inlets to units), this is increased by 1 due to the removal of a constraint on the sum of mole fractions.
	
	Equations of state are generally applied in the fields of physical chemistry and chemical engineering, particularly in the modeling of vaporâ€“liquid equilibrium and chemical engineering process design. Following the work of \citet{Poling2001}, the general cubic equation of state is represented by the following equations:
	
	{\footnotesize
	\begin{equation} \label{EQ: General_Qubic}
		P = \frac{RT}{v_m-b} - \frac{\Theta \left( v_m - \eta \right)}{\left( v_m - b \right) \left(v_m^2 + \delta v_m + \epsilon \right) }
	\end{equation}
	}
	
	where, depending upon the model, the parameters $\Theta,~b,~\delta,~\epsilon$ may be constants, including zero, or they may vary with $T$ and / or composition. Thus, the distinctions among cubic EoS models for pure components are which of the parameters in Equation \ref{EQ: General_Qubic} are nonzero and how they are made to vary with $T$. A common notation for EOS is to use $\Theta(T)=a\alpha(T)$, where $\alpha(T_c) = 1$. Tables \ref{tab:Popular_Cubic_EoS} and \ref{tab:Popular_Cubic_EoS_alpha} give relations among the Equation \ref{EQ: General_Qubic} parameters for several common cubic EoS.

	Equation \ref{EQ: General_Qubic} can be written to obtain the compressibility as given by Equation \ref{EQ:Comp_EOS}.
