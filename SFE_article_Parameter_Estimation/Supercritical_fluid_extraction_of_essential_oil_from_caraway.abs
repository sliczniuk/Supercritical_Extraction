This study investigated the supercritical extraction process of caraway oil from caraway seeds. A distributed-parameter model describes the fluid-solid extraction process. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. Key model parameters included partition factor internal and axial diffusion coefficients. These parameters and the initial state were determined using maximum likelihood estimation from experimental data, assuming normal error. A set of laboratory experiments was performed in a partially filled extractor with a fixed bed operated under multiple constant operating conditions: $40~^\circ C$ / $200$ bar, $50~^\circ C$ / $200$ bar, $40~^\circ C$ / $300$ bar, and $50~^\circ C$ / $300$ bar.
