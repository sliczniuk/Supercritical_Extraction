This study aimed to investigate the supercritical extraction process of caraway oil from caraway seeds. The extraction was performed in a partially filled extractor with a fixed bed operated under multiple operating conditions. A distributed-parameter model describes the fluid-solid extraction process with $CO_2$ as a solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The local sensitivity analysis investigates the influence of infinitely small changes in the inlet temperature, pressure, and flow rate on the extraction yield.
