Given a system of partial differential equations, $F(t,x,\dot{x},p,u)=0$, where $x$ represents state variables, $p$ are the parameters, and $u$ are control variables, the process model is simultaneously solved for both $x_i$ and a set of sensitivity functions, $dx_i/dp_j$, overall times $t$.These sensitivity functions measure the influence of the parameter change on the model's output. As an example, the supercritical extraction process is presented. The impact of mass flow rate, pressure, and inlet temperature on the model's output is discussed. The sensitivity analysis results prove that the considered variables can affect the extraction's yield and be used as control variables in optimization problems. Moreover, the local sensitivity analysis results are analyzed from a phenomenological point of view to enhance understanding of the process model.
