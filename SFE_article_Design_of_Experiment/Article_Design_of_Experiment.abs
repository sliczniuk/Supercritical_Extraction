This study aimed to investigate the supercritical extraction process of caraway oil from caraway seeds. The extraction was performed in a partially filled extractor with a fixed bed operated under multiple operating conditions. A distributed-parameter model describes the fluid-solid extraction process with $CO_2$ as a solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor.
The optimal design of experiment problem is solved to find an experimental strategy for validating the correlations between extraction kinetic parameters and the operating conditions. This work proposes two experimental strategies: one that only manipulates the inlet temperature and the second that manipulate only the pressure.
