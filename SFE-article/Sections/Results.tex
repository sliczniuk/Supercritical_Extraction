	\label{CH: Results}

    The parameter estimation problem was solved by fitting the process model to the dataset given in the table \ref{tab: Yield_data}. Each time-series was fitted to the model separately. As a result of fitting, the following parameters were obtained:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Partition coefficient:\qquad\quad\qquad$k_m$
        \item Internal Diffusion coefficient: \quad$D_i$
        \item Axial Diffusion coefficient: \qquad$D_e^M$
        \item Standard Deviation: \qquad\qquad\quad$\sigma$
    \end{itemize}

    Moreover, the initial state estimation was performed together with parameter estimation. The concentration of solute in the solid phase is assumed to be constant and uniformly distributed. On the other hand, the solute concentration in the fluid phase should not follow the same assumption as the solid phase. During the preparation period the solute diffuses to the fluid phase in contact with the solid particles. Later, the solute in the fluid phase is partially moved (if the pressure increase in the system, the pump cause the movement of the fluid, even if the outlet valve is closed) along the extractor. As a result, the distribution of solutes mass in the fluid phase is assumed to not be uniform. Some conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the initial part of each yield curve. It can be noticed that each curve at the beginning has a curvature, which is not linear. In a general sense, it can be said that a quadratic function could approximate the initial part of each extraction curve. A function that, after integration, gives a quadratic-like result is a straight line. Based on that observation, the solute concentration in the fluid phase is assumed to be linearly distributed. The solute concentration is assumed to be zero at the outlet and reach the maximum at the beginning of the fixed bed. The details on the calculation are given in appendix \ref{CH: IC_BC}. The linear distribution can be defined if the total mass of solute $m_{total}$ and partition coefficient $\tau$ are know.
    
    Due to initial state estimation, two additional parameters are fitted.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Total mass of solute: \qquad\qquad\quad$m_{total}$
        \item Partition coefficient: \qquad\qquad\quad$\tau$
    \end{itemize}

	To ensure that parameters found by the optimizer do not reach unrealistic values, an additional set of inequality constraints is introduced. The lower and upper bounds for each parameter are given in Table \ref{tab:Constraints}.

		\end{tabular} }

	The parameter estimation problem requires an initial guess as an input to an optimization problem. To ensure that the solution is a global solution multiple initial points have been tested. The initial guesses for the parameter estimation problem are given in Table \ref{tab:InitialGuess}

			Initial guess	&1	  	& 3 	  	& 1 		& 77 		 	& 0.65 	   	& 0.1 \\  \hline

	The figure \ref{fig: estimation_results} show yield curves for each of experiments. The blue dots indicate the data point obtained as a measurement from the laboratory experiments. The black curve represents the yield curve obtained from the initial guess of the parameters. The blue curve correspond to yield curve obtained as a solution of the optimization problem. The curves on the left hand-side of the Figure \ref{fig: estimation_results}, are the cumulative yield curves, which represents the cumulative amount of the oil collected during each experiment. The Figures on the right hand-side, represent the derivative of the cumulative yield curves. As explained in the chapter \ref{CH: Parameter_estimation}, the derivatives of the cumulative measurements are independent on the previous measurement and should be used for the parameter estimation.

	The results of the parameter estimation can be found in Table \ref{tab: Estimation_results}. As can be noticed, the optimizer found that the partition factor should be as high as possible and moved values of $k_m$ for each experiment to unity, which was chosen as the upper bound.
	
	Values of the internal diffusion coefficients are distinguished for each experiment, with an increasing trend with respect to the fluid density. The order of magnitude of $D_i$ obtained from the optimization is similar to values found by other researcher (\todo[fancyline]{REF}).
