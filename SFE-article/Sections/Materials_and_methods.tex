	\sout{The extraction process is assumed to operate in a semi-continuous mode in a cylindrical vessel. The solvent is firstly brought to super-critical condition, pumped through a fixed-bed, of finely chopped biomass, where the solute is extracted from the biomass. Then, the solvent and solute from the extractor are separated in a flush drum, and the extract is collected. The flow rate ($F_{in}$) and inlet temperature ($T_{in}$) of the extractorâ€™s feed can be measured and manipulated. The pressure ($P$) in the vessel can be measured and manipulated, while the outlet temperature ($T_{out}$) can only be measured. A simplified flow diagram is depicted in Figure \ref{fig: SFE_drawing} }.
