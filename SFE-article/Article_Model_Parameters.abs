Given a system of partial differential equations, $F(t,x,\dot{x},p,u)=0$, where $x$ represents state variables, $p$ are the parameters, and $u$ are control variables, we describe the supercritical extraction process. The process model describes a partially filled extractor with a fixed bed, which work under constant operating conditions. We assume that the flow is uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase is a function of distance. We apply the concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow to mimic the modelling of a two-dimensional case.
The collected dataset, obtained from the extraction of caraway seeds at different operating conditions, is used to estimate unknown parameters. The model-based parameter estimation applies the maximum likelihood method to estimate values of the extraction kinetic parameters such as mass partition factor, internal diffusion coefficient and radial diffusion.
