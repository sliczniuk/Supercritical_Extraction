The aim of this study was to investigate the supercritical extraction process of the caraway oil from caraway seeds from a partially filled extractor with a fixed bed that was operated under multiple constant operating conditions. The dataset collected from the experiments consists of four experiments conducted at different operating conditions: $40^\circ C$/$200$ bar, $50^\circ C$/$200$ bar, $40^\circ C$/$300$ bar, and $50^\circ C$/$300$ bar. To describe the fluid-solid extraction process with $CO_2$ as a solvent, a distributed-parameter model is used. It is assumed that the flow is uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. To model this two-dimensional case, the concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied. This model requires parameters such as partition factor, internal diffusion coefficient, axial diffusion coefficient, saturation concentration, and an initial state estimate. These parameters are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state and by applying the maximum likelihood estimation method on yield data under the normal error assumption.
