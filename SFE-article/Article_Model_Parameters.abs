We consider a system of partial differential equations, $F(t,x,\dot{x},\Theta,u)=0$, where $x$ denotes the state variables, $\Theta$ represents the parameters, and $u$ is the control variables. Our focus is on the supercritical extraction process, which involves a partially filled extractor with a fixed bed that operates under constant conditions. We assume the flow is uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. To model this two-dimensional case, we use the concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow.
To describe the fluid-solid extraction process of caraway oil from caraway seeds with $CO_2$ as a solvent, we use a distributed-parameter model based on \citet{Reverchon1996}. This model requires parameters such as partition factor, internal diffusion coefficient, axial diffusion coefficient, and saturation concentration. We estimate these parameters from four experiments at different temperatures and pressures: $40^\circ C$/$200$ bar, $50^\circ C$/$200$ bar, $40^\circ C$/$300$ bar, and $50^\circ C$/$300$ bar. We obtain the parameter values using the maximum likelihood estimation method on yield data under the normal error assumption.
