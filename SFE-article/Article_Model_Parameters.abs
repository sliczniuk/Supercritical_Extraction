Given a system of partial differential equations, $F(t,x,\dot{x},\Theta,u)=0$, where $x$ represents state variables, $\Theta$ are the parameters, and $u$ are control variables, we describe the supercritical extraction process. The process model describes a partially filled extractor with a fixed bed, which work under constant operating conditions. We assume that the flow is uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can change along the extractor. We apply the concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow to mimic the modelling of a two-dimensional case.
In this work, a distributed-parameter model, based on \citet{Reverchon1996} is used to describe a fluid-solid extraction process of caraway oil from caraway seeds with $CO_2$ as a solvent. The model parameters such as partition factor, internal diffusion coefficient, axial diffusion coefficient and saturation concentration are obtained from parameter estimation. The parameters are estimated based on four experiments performed at $40^\circ C$ and $50^\circ C$ at $200$ bar and $300$ bar. Given yield data, the model-based parameter estimation uses the maximum likelihood estimation method under assumption of normal error.
