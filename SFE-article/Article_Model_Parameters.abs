A system of partial differential equations, $G(t,x,\dot{x},\Theta,u)=0$ is considered, where $x$ denotes the state variables, $\Theta$ represents the parameters, and $u$ is the control variables. The system $G(t,x,\dot{x},\Theta,u)=0$ describe the supercritical extraction process, which involves a partially filled extractor with a fixed bed that operates under constant conditions. It is assumed that the flow is uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. To model this two-dimensional case, the concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied.
To describe the fluid-solid extraction process of caraway oil from caraway seeds with $CO_2$ as a solvent, we use the distributed-parameter model $G(t,x,\dot{x},\Theta,u)=0$ based on \citet{Reverchon1996}. This model requires parameters such as partition factor, internal diffusion coefficient, axial diffusion coefficient, saturation concentration, and an initial state estimate. These parameters are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state and by applying the maximum likelihood estimation method on yield data under the normal error assumption.
The dataset comes from four experiments conducted at different operating conditions: $40^\circ C$/$200$ bar, $50^\circ C$/$200$ bar, $40^\circ C$/$300$ bar, and $50^\circ C$/$300$ bar.
